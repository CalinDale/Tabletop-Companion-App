<h1>{{character.name}}</h1>
Proper routing is not implemented yet, so this is the only character that shows.

<ul class="attributes">
  <li *ngFor="let attribute of character.attributes">
    {{attribute.name}}: {{attribute.type}} = {{attribute.value}}
  </li>
</ul>

These buttons are just to give us an idea of the functionality that should be built.
<br>
The functionality does not need to be in buttons, nor does it even need specific functions.
<br>
  <button (click)="addAttribute()">Add attribute</button>
<br>
  <button (click)="editAttribute()">Edit attribute</button>
<br>
  <button (click)="removeAttribute()">Remove attribute</button>
<br>
  <button (click)="reorderAttribute()">reoorder attribute</button>
<br>
  <button (click)="rename()">Rename</button>
